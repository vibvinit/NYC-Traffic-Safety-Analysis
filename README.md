# NYC-Traffic-Safety-Analysis

### About this project

#### Objective
Analyse New York City traffic accident data to identify key factors contributing to collisions and generate actionable insights aimed at improving road safety. By leveraging data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualisation, the goal is to support evidence-based recommendations that help reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities across the city.

#### 1. Data Exploration & Understanding
The project began with an exploratory analysis to understand the structure, scope, and key variables in the dataset. This included identifying relevant fields such as date/time of incidents, location, contributing factors, and counts of injuries and fatalities. Initial exploration helped pinpoint data quality issues and guided the overall direction of the analysis.

#### 2. Data Cleaning & Wrangling
To ensure the dataset was reliable and ready for analysis, I performed data cleaning tasks:

  a. Removed or imputed missing and null values.
  b. Corrected inconsistent data entries (e.g., typos or varying formats).
  c. Filtered out irrelevant records and standardised variable types.

This step ensured that the data was accurate, consistent, and suitable for meaningful analysis.

#### 3. Feature Engineering & Metric Creation
After cleaning, I created key analytical metrics to enhance insight generation:

d. Total Fatalities
e. Percentage of Dangerous Collisions
f. Other aggregated indicators, such as average accidents per borough and peak-time collision rates.

These metrics allowed a clearer and more interpretable view of traffic safety performance across different dimensions.

#### 4. Data Visualization
To uncover patterns and trends, I created a variety of visualisations, including:

g. Bar charts for borough-wise collision comparisons.
h. Line graphs to show time-based trends (daily, monthly).
i. Scatter plots for examining relationships between contributing factors and accident severity.

These visuals revealed accident hotspots, peak hours, seasonal trends, and high-risk factors contributing to collisions.

##### 5. Insights & Recommendations
Based on the visual and quantitative analysis, I derived insights and formulated practical recommendations to improve road safety, such as:

j. Implementing stricter traffic controls in high-risk zones.
k. Enhancing signage and lighting in accident-prone areas.
l. Launching targeted public safety awareness campaigns during peak accident periods.
