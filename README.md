# NYC-Traffic-Safety-Analysis

### About this project

This project begins with a detailed exploration and understanding of the NYC traffic accident data to identify key variables and potential issues. The next step was data cleaning, where I removed the missing or null values, and inconsistencies, to ensure the dataset was complete and ready for analysis. Once the data was cleaned, I created critical measures such as the Total Fatalities, Percentage of Dangerous Collisions, and other relevant metrics that provide a clearer picture of traffic safety across the city.

With these metrics in place, I then created visualizations such as bar charts, scatter charts, and line graphs to uncover trends, patterns, and hotspots of traffic incidents. These visualizations help highlight areas with higher accident rates, peak hours, and key factors of collisions.

Finally, based on the findings from the data analysis and visual insights, I generated actionable recommendations. These recommendations focus on improving road safety measures, such as suggesting changes in traffic laws, enhanced signage in high-risk areas, and targeted safety campaigns to reduce fatalities and dangerous collisions. The ultimate goal is to use data-driven insights to enhance traffic safety.
